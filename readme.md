# Yet, Another Housing Prices Problem!

This is a machine learning project with Python that aims to build a machine learning model to predict housing prices in California. The data used in this project was downloaded from Kaggle.

## Python Packages

The following Python packages were used in this project:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Model Selection

The models were selected based on their initial performance, followed by cross-validation, and learning and validation curves.

## Performance

The final model achieved an R-squared metric of about 85.18% after performing bayesian optimization..

## Additional Information

This project was a part of a data science and machine learning training boot camp sponsored by GDSC.

Please refer to the project code for more detailed information on the implementation.
